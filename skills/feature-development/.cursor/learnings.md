# Feature Development Skill - Learnings

## Key Discoveries

### Effective Development Practices
- Start with understanding the problem and requirements thoroughly
- Break down complex features into smaller, manageable components
- Follow existing code patterns and architectural decisions
- Write tests alongside feature implementation (TDD/BDD)
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios early

### Architecture Considerations
- Understand the existing system architecture before making changes
- Follow single responsibility principle for new components
- Consider scalability and performance implications
- Design for maintainability and extensibility
- Use appropriate design patterns for the problem domain

### AI-Assisted Development Techniques
- Use semantic search to understand existing implementations
- Leverage code search to find similar patterns and reuse code
- Build context incrementally through exploration
- Cross-reference existing tests to understand expected behavior
- Use codebase analysis to maintain consistency

## Gotchas

### Context is Everything
- Always understand the full business context before starting
- Check for existing similar functionality that could be extended
- Understand the target users and their workflows
- Consider the impact on existing features and systems

### Technical Debt and Constraints
- Be aware of existing technical debt that might affect implementation
- Understand performance constraints and requirements
- Consider security implications of new features
- Account for existing bugs that might affect new functionality

### Team and Process Considerations
- Follow established team conventions and coding standards
- Consider the review process and feedback cycles
- Plan for proper testing and quality assurance
- Think about documentation and knowledge sharing

## Best Practices

### Planning Phase
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understand what needs to be built
2. **Technical Design** - Plan the implementation approach
3. **Impact Assessment** - Consider effects on existing system
4. **Resource Planning** - Estimate time and complexity
5. **Risk Identification** - Identify potential challenges

### Development Phase
1. **Iterative Development** - Build in small, testable increments
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests before implementation
3. **Code Review Integration** - Plan for review feedback cycles
4. **Documentation** - Document complex logic and decisions
5. **Performance Considerations** - Monitor and optimize as needed

### Quality Assurance
1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
2. **Edge Case Handling** - Consider unusual input and error conditions
3. **Performance Testing** - Ensure scalability requirements are met
4. **Security Review** - Check for vulnerabilities and security issues
5. **User Experience** - Validate usability and user workflows

### Knowledge Management
1. **Document Decisions** - Record architectural and design choices
2. **Share Learnings** - Update team knowledge and guidelines
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify reusable patterns and components
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Reflect on process and outcomes

## Common Patterns

### Feature Implementation Flow
1. **Research and Context** - Understand the problem domain
2. **Design and Planning** - Create implementation plan
3. **Core Implementation** - Build the main functionality
4. **Testing and Validation** - Ensure quality and correctness
5. **Integration and Polish** - Connect with existing systems
6. **Documentation and Handoff** - Prepare for deployment and maintenance

### Code Organization
- **Modular Design** - Break features into logical components
- **Separation of Concerns** - Keep different responsibilities separate
- **Consistent Naming** - Use clear, descriptive names
- **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error management
- **Configuration Management** - Use proper configuration patterns

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests** - Validate scalability and speed
- **Security Tests** - Check for vulnerabilities

## Technology-Specific Insights

### Frontend Development
- **State Management** - Choose appropriate state management patterns
- **Component Design** - Create reusable, maintainable components
- **Performance Optimization** - Minimize bundle size and runtime performance
- **Accessibility** - Ensure features are accessible to all users
- **Responsive Design** - Support multiple device types and screen sizes

### Backend Development
- **API Design** - Create clean, RESTful or GraphQL APIs
- **Database Design** - Structure data efficiently and maintainably
- **Caching Strategy** - Implement appropriate caching mechanisms
- **Security Implementation** - Protect against common vulnerabilities
- **Monitoring and Logging** - Enable proper observability

### Full-Stack Considerations
- **Data Flow** - Design clear data flow between frontend and backend
- **Error Handling** - Implement consistent error handling across layers
