# Cursor Rules

1. Each web service requiring new automation gets its own subdirectory under `services/`.
   - Store Playwright scripts and service-specific context here for reuse.
2. Secrets (login credentials, API keys) must be stored in a `.env` file.
   - `.env` is gitignored and cursorignored.
   - Load secrets via scripts or terminal commands using `dotenv` to avoid leaking credentials.
3. Use Playwright for browser control.
   - Place temporary scripts in `tmp/` (gitignored); these can be thrown away.
   - Reusable scripts (e.g., login flows) should be saved in the appropriate service subdirectory.
