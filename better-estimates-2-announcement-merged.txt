üöÄ *Launch Announcement: Better Estimates 2.0 - Tax Credits Estimation Engine*

ü§î *Why This Matters*
With Better Estimates 2.0, customers get accurate, up-to-date tax credit projections in their dashboards. Reliable estimates build trust, reduce support effort, and drive higher conversion by demonstrating value early.

*Background on the Problem*

Our current tax credit estimation system faces several critical challenges that impact customer experience and operational efficiency:

‚Ä¢ *Inaccurate Estimates*: Estimates are often lower than actual credit amounts, leading to customer disappointment and reduced trust
‚Ä¢ *Data Inconsistency*: ZP and Mithrin surfaces show different estimates for the same company, creating confusion for customers and internal teams
‚Ä¢ *Operational Burden*: Troubleshooting and testing estimates requires significant manual effort from our engineering teams
‚Ä¢ *Performance Constraints*: The current Airflow-based architecture creates bottlenecks when processing ~400,000 companies, with potential 7-28 hour processing times

These issues directly impact customer satisfaction and our ability to scale tax credit services effectively.


‚ú® *What's New in Better Estimates 2.0*

We've completely redesigned our estimation architecture to address these core problems:

üîÑ *Event-Driven Architecture*
‚Ä¢ *Smart Triggering*: Generate forecasting jobs only when underlying data actually changes, eliminating unnecessary processing
‚Ä¢ *Kafka Integration*: Event-driven estimate updates triggered when relevant data changes, replacing daily offline batch jobs with real-time Kafka streaming for improved scalability


üèóÔ∏è *Modernized Stateless Calculation Service*
‚Ä¢ *Refactored from Legacy*: Replaced slow database-driven legacy calculation with modernized stateless service for improved performance
‚Ä¢ *Improved Reliability*: Stateless design enables better fault tolerance and easier horizontal scaling
‚Ä¢ *Faster Processing*: Parallel processing capabilities with configurable batch sizes (1 to N companies)


üéØ *Expected Impact*

‚Ä¢ *Near-term:*
	‚Ä¢ *Accuracy*: More precise estimates that better align with actual credit amounts
	‚Ä¢ *Consistency*: 100% alignment between ZP and Mithrin estimate displays
	‚Ä¢ *Performance*: Reduced processing time from hours to minutes for estimate updates
	‚Ä¢ *Efficiency*: Improved estimate engine efficiency - ~43k estimates calculated per day vs. previously 400k+ per day
‚Ä¢ *Long-term:*
	‚Ä¢ *Customer Trust*: Improved estimate accuracy leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention
	‚Ä¢ *Operational Efficiency*: Streamlined troubleshooting and testing processes
	‚Ä¢ *Scalability*: Architecture ready for future expansion to additional credit types


üõ£Ô∏è *Next Steps*

1. *Monitor Performance*: Track processing times and accuracy improvements post-launch
2. *Gather Feedback*: Collect input from customer-facing teams on estimate quality
3. *Remove Legacy Process*: Sunset the old Airflow-based estimation system
4. *Expand Estimates*: Add other R&D calculation methods, state R&D credits, and other tax credits
